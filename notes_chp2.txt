$ git status  <===

Till now, the local repo and remote repo are up-to-date and synced . 




if you switch directory , for example to  /c/pluralsight/GitHub/Code/Broadworks
$ pwd
/c/pluralsight/GitHub/Code/Broadworks

so when you do a   "git remote -v" , you will see the remote Github already chagned to different repository.

$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:awschatswood/broadworks.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:awschatswood/broadworks.git (push)



Example 2: make change on the remote repository only. 




$ git fetch   <<======== (fetch only fetch the change but does not merge) 
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

   c90e4dd..ae233bd  master     -> origin/master


$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded. <<=== this told you , local is behind remote) 
 <<======== (fetch only fetch the change but does not merge, so the local is behind the remote repo)
 
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ git pull  <<======== (pull  will do both fetch and merge)

Example 3: Made change both locally and remotely. 

1. first change on the remote Github. 

2. i then make change locally ( to modify the README.md file) 

$ git add .

in order to resolve the issue, we have to

Unmerged paths:

        both modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")



$ git pull

fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.


so what i did is have to fix the change manually( basically , i delete the local change) 


$ np README.md

( i just removed the local change)
